There is not one cause, and everyone present differently. Addiction looks different in everyone because we are all different in our experiences, upbringings and contexts. \n\nSubstance abuse such as prescription medication, alcohol, heroin, cocaine, crystal meth, cannabis, are common in South Africa at the moment. Process addiction such as sex, love, gambling, gaming, shopping etc. are just as significant and can have the same disastrous effects on the addict. Process addiction is often misunderstood or seen as less than substance abuse. \n\n**I can help you make sense of your addiction**, explore your triggers, your thinking and maladaptive behaviors in response to it. \n"}],component:"page"},slug:c,full_slug:c,default_full_slug:b,sort_by_date:b,position:20,tag_list:[],is_startpage:false,parent_id:0,meta_data:b,group_id:"c0bd028e-4e0c-42d5-9c95-311ae679e9c7",first_published_at:"2021-01-09T01:26:45.961Z",release_id:b,lang:"default",path:b,translated_slugs:[]}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("",null,"addiction","Addiction | Michelle Smit","https:\u002F\u002Fa.storyblok.com\u002Ff\u002F101001\u002F697x886\u002Fef66c7389e\u002Fmichellesmit.jpg","I have been the clinical leader of a licensed psychiatric hospital with a specialized addiction unit for many years.
