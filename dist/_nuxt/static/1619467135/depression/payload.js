It is normal to be sad when facing difficulties in life and we often feel overwhelmed by it. In response to the death of a loved one, loss of a job, relationship problems are a few examples of when we may feel overwhelmed emotionally. \n\nDepression can be felt for a short time such as in response to an experience, or it can be something more serious, long term. Depression affects everyone differently, and you might only have some of these symptoms. You may also have other symptoms that aren’t listed here. Keep in mind that it’s also normal to have some of these symptoms from time to time without having depression.\n\nBut if they start to impact your day-to-day life, they may be the result of depression.\n\n**According to the American psychiatric association:**\n\nDepression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:\n\n* Feeling sad or having a depressed mood\n\n* Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed\n\n* Changes in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting\n\n* Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much\n\n* Loss of energy or increased fatigue\n\n* Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., inability to sit still, pacing, handwringing) or slowed movements or speech (these actions must be severe enough to be observable by others)\n\n* Feeling worthless or guilty\n\n* Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions\n\n* Thoughts of death or suicide\n\nSymptoms must last at least two weeks and must represent a change in your previous level of functioning for a diagnosis of depression."},{_uid:"367a6973-7e27-4085-9dc6-f083a6094c7c",title:"Common types of depression",columns:[{_uid:"8e27bbef-ffcc-4159-b522-520794300a2c",title:"Situational depression",component:c,description:"[Situational depression](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.healthline.com\u002Fhealth\u002Fdepression\u002Fsituational-depression), clinically known as adjustment disorder with depressed mood, looks like major depression in many respects.\n\nBut it’s brought on by specific events or situations, such as:\n\n* the death of a loved one\n* a serious illness or other life-threatening event\n* going through divorce or child custody issues\n* being in emotionally or physically abusive relationships\n* being unemployed or facing serious financial difficulties\n* facing extensive legal troubles\n\nOf course, it’s normal to feel sad and anxious during events like these — even to withdraw from others for a bit.
